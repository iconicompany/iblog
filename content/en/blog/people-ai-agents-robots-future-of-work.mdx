## More Than Half of Work – Under Automation

According to estimates by McKinsey Global Institute, **about 57% of working time in the USA is potentially automatable with current technology levels**. Of this:

* **44%** can be performed by **AI agents** – software systems capable of analyzing data, making decisions, and acting autonomously;
* **13%** – by **robots**, performing physical and routine operations.

These figures do not mean "the disappearance of jobs." They indicate a much more significant shift: **work ceases to be monolithic**. It breaks down into tasks, and each task gets its most efficient performer – a human, an agent, or a robot.

## AI Agents as a New Class of "Workers"

While robots are traditionally associated with physical labor, **AI agents represent the automation of mental, digital work**:

* processing applications and documents
* data analysis and scoring
* customer support
* process coordination between systems
* making standard decisions within business rules

This is precisely why the proportion of tasks potentially performed by agents is so high – **44% of all working hours**. A significant portion of the modern economy is not physical production, but work with information, processes, and decisions.

In fact, AI agents are becoming **digital employees**, integrated into business processes: they do not "help," they **work**.

## Where Humans Remain

At the same time, **43% of working time is not automatable**. The key reason is **social and emotional skills**, which still remain the human domain:

* complex negotiations
* people management
* empathy and trust
* creativity and meaning-making
* decision-making under uncertainty and value conflicts

Even in tasks where AI is actively involved, humans increasingly perform the role of:

* solution architect
* controller and arbitrator
* bearer of responsibility

The future is not "human versus machine," but **human + agent + robot**.

## New Labor Architecture

If we look at the labor market as a system, it becomes obvious:
we are moving towards a **hybrid architecture**, where:

* **humans** are responsible for goals, meanings, and interaction;
* **AI agents** – for speed, scale, and accuracy in digital processes;
* **robots** – for physical execution and repetitive operations.

Future companies will compete not only with teams of people but also with the **quality of their agents**: their architecture, training, integration, and ability to work in conjunction with humans.

It is not the profession that is automated, but the **task**.
Those who win are not those who "replace humans," but those who **correctly assemble a system of humans, agents, and robots**.

This is precisely the main managerial and technological challenge of the coming years.
