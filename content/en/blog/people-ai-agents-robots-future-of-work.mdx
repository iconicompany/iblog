## More Than Half of Work is Susceptible to Automation

According to estimates by the McKinsey Global Institute, **about 57% of working time in the US is potentially automatable with current technology levels**. Of this:

*   **44%** can be performed by **AI agents** – software systems capable of analyzing data, making decisions, and acting autonomously.
*   **13%** can be performed by **robots**, executing physical and routine operations.

These figures do not imply the "disappearance of jobs." They point to a much more significant shift: **work is ceasing to be monolithic**. It is breaking down into tasks, and each task is assigned to its most efficient performer – a human, an agent, or a robot.

## AI Agents as a New Class of "Workers"

While robots are traditionally associated with physical labor, **AI agents represent the automation of cognitive, digital work**:

*   Processing requests and documents
*   Data analysis and scoring
*   Customer support
*   Coordinating processes between systems
*   Making typical decisions within business rules

This is precisely why the proportion of tasks potentially performed by agents is so high – **44% of all working hours**. A significant portion of the modern economy is not about physical production, but about working with information, processes, and decisions.

In essence, AI agents are becoming **digital employees** integrated into business processes: they don't "help," they **work**.

## Where Humans Remain Indispensable

At the same time, **43% of working time is not automatable**. The key reason is **social and emotional skills**, which still remain in the human domain:

*   Complex negotiations
*   People management
*   Empathy and trust
*   Creativity and meaning-making
*   Decision-making under uncertainty and value conflicts

Even in tasks where AI actively participates, humans increasingly take on the role of:

*   Solution architects
*   Controllers and arbiters
*   Bearers of responsibility

The future is not "human versus machine," but **human + agent + robot**.

## A New Labor Architecture

Looking at the labor market as a system makes it evident: we are moving towards a **hybrid architecture** where:

*   **Humans** are responsible for goals, meanings, and interaction.
*   **AI agents** are responsible for speed, scale, and accuracy in digital processes.
*   **Robots** are responsible for physical execution and repetitive operations.

Future companies will compete not only with their human teams but also with the **quality of their agents**: their architecture, training, integration, and ability to work in conjunction with humans.

It is not the profession that is automated, but the **task**.
Those who win are not those who "replace people," but those who **correctly assemble a system of humans, agents, and robots**.

This is precisely the main managerial and technological challenge of the coming years.
